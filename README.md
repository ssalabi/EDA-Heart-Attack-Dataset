<h1>EDA-Heart-Attack-Dataset</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of exploring and visualizing the Heart Attack Dataset provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains 303 patients. Each patient has 13 biomarkers (features) like his age,sex,cp.. and a binary target label "heart attack". I established correlations between features, plotted some interesting statistical measures and based on my observations, built a machine learning classification model to predict whether or not the patient was having a heart attack based on the features given.
